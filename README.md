# 💖 Do You Have a Crush on Me? 😍

Welcome to the cutest project on GitHub! This is a playful interactive webpage where you can confess your crush or have fun dodging the cheeky "No" button. Perfect for spreading joy and smiles! 🌟

## 🌟 Features
- **Adorable Design**: A sweet and visually pleasing interface that screams "cute!"
- **Interactive Fun**:
  - If you click "Yes," you'll see a heartwarming response with an equally adorable GIF.
  - If you hover over "No," the button will try to escape, making it nearly impossible to click!
- **Responsive**: Works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🎨 Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For the lovable styling.
- **JavaScript**: For all the interactive magic.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cute-crush-game.git
   cd cute-crush-game
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.

 cute-crush-game/
 |-- index.html       # Main HTML file
 |-- style.css        # Styling file
